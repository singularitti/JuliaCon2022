    Operations like finding the symmetry of a crystal,
    are very common in \ab{} calculations (usually the first step).
    Therefore, we need a good library to do this.

    There is a C library called \href{https://github.com/spglib/spglib}{\texttt{spglib}}
    that does this.
    To take this library in productive use, we need first put it in a container
    (``Artifacts''). Luckily, the amazing Julia community has made it possible:
    \href{https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/spglib_jll.jl}{\texttt{spglib_jll.jl}}.

            Now that we have an artifact that exports the functions of the C library,
            it may still be hard to use since it uses some C data structures and API still which may
            not be idiomatic Julia. Therefore, we need to wrap it with a higher level of APIs:
            \href{https://github.com/singularitti/Spglib.jl}{\texttt{Spglib.jl}} is built based on
            this expectation.
