\subsection{What are \ab{} calculations?}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{What are \ab{} calculations?}
    \begin{definitionblock}{\ab{} calculation}
        A method of calculating atomic and molecular structure directly from the first
        principles of quantum mechanics, without using quantities derived from experiment
        as parameters.
    \end{definitionblock}

    If still confused, have a look at \href{https://youtu.be/-RomkxjlIcQ}{the introduction video of \texttt{DFTK.jl}}.

    Some typical \ab{} calculations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electronic structure calculation
        \item Structure optimization, prediction, and search
        \item \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics
        \item Phonons and vibrational spectra calculation
        \item Many-body Green's functions
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Various \ab{} software}
    To do \ab{} calculations, it is inevitable to interact with \ab{} software.
    There are a lot of them on the market, e.g., \qe{}, VASP, and ABINIT.
    They are often written in Fortran, and needed to be compiled to executable
    when using.

    So building a workflow for them requires us to create parsers for their input and output
    files, as well as functions to dynamically run these executables.
