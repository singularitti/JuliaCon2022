\section{How to build an \ab{} workflow system}

\begin{frame}{What is \express{}, though?}
    A Julia-written
    \begin{itemize}
        \item extensible,
        \item lightweight,
        \item high-throughput,
        \item high-level
    \end{itemize}
    workflow framework that aims to automate \ab{} calculations for the materials science
    community.

\begin{frame}{What is needed in an \ab{} workflow system?}
    There are at least three components:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sciency, technical stuff: calculations, input generation, output analysis...
        \item Dispatcher, job scheduler: interacting with \ab{} software, \texttt{mpi}...
        \item User interface: interacting with users
    \end{itemize}
