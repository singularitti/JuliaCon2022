  abstract = {This paper brings an overall view of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) used in VLab, a system aimed to handle concurrent calculations of geo-materials participating in extensive workflows. We recap the algorithms of physical importance that underly the system requirements. The system architecture then emerges naturally. A usage view diagram is shown and thoroughly discussed. We also show how analysis tools are integrated in the SOA.}
